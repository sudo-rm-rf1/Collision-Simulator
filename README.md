# Collision Simulator
## Description

Open source physics collision simulator made in Python using pygame. It uses the law of conservation of momentum and law of conservation of energy in a closed system to simulate many perfectly elastic collisions. Also shows information on the position, velocity, momentum, and kinetic energy of the balls during collisions. Also has arrows that show the velocity vector of the balls with the length of the line corresponding to the relative magnitudes of the balls' velocities.
